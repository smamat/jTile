To checkout new branch from remote (that doesn't exist locally):
1. git remote update
2. git checkout -b LetterList origin/LetterList

To update local branch to remote branch
1. git push [alias to remote] [local branch]
	e.g. git push origin localbranch

To update local branch with remote branch, when local branch is several commits behind (fast-forwarding)
1. git fetch [alias to remote]
2. git merge [alias to remote]/[local branch]
	e.g. (while in "master" branch): git fetch origin; git merge origin/master
